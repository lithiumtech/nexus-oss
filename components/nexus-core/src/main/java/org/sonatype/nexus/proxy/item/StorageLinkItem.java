 * An item that is a link (idea very similar to Linux symlink). It points to some other content (generated or not) in
 * any repository within this Nexus instance (even cross repository). It cannot point to target not in repository (like
 * virtual items). Link itself might be virtual. The path where target UID points might not exists (link is still valid
 * but stale, as dereferencing it will result simply in {@link ItemNotFoundException}), but if the link target UID
 * points to a non existing {@link Repository}, link will be automatically removed by Nexus on retrieving the link
 * itself and {@link ItemNotFoundException} will be thrown.
 * <p>
 * For dereferencing links recommended method is {@link RepositoryRouter#dereferenceLink(StorageLinkItem)}.
